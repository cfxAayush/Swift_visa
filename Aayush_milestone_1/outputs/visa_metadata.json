        "text": "Ireland\u2019s visa policy Ireland distinguishes between short\u2011stay visas (type C, up to 90 days) and long\u2011stay visas (type D, more than 90 days) for non\u2011EU/EEA/Swiss and non\u2011UK nationals. Visa\u2011exempt nationals (for example many Annex II countries, US, etc.) can enter without a visa for short visits but must still respect immigration permission conditions at the border. Ireland is not part of Schengen; a Schengen visa does not allow entry to Ireland, and an Irish visa does not allow entry to Schengen countries. Who needs a visa Citizens of EU/EEA, Switzerland and the UK do not need a visa to enter Ireland, though they may still need to register for residence depending on length and purpose of stay. Many non\u2011EU countries are visa\u2011exempt for short stays, but large groups (including India, Pakistan, Nigeria, etc.) must obtain a visa even for tourism or short visits. Some nationalities are exempt from visa fees but not from the visa requirement itself. Short stay \u201cC\u201d visa (\u226490 days) The standard short\u2011stay \u201cC\u201d visa covers tourism, visiting family/friends, business, short training or study (e.g., short English courses) for a maximum of 90 days. Applicants must show a valid reason for travel, proof of accommodation, full travel itinerary, travel/medical insurance, and sufficient funds without recourse to public funds. A key requirement is evidence of strong ties (family, social, economic) to the country of residence to show you will leave Ireland before your permission expires. Long stay \u201cD\u201d visa (>90 days) A long\u2011stay \u201cD\u201d visa is needed if you intend to study, work, join family, or otherwise remain in Ireland for more than 90 days. After arrival with a D visa, you must register locally with Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) or GNIB to get an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) and an immigration stamp (e.g., Stamp 1, 2, 3, 4) that defines your rights to work, study, or access services. Different D\u2011visa categories (study, employment, family reunification, research, etc.) have tailored document and financial requirements. Student visa policies (including 2025 fund change) For long\u2011term study, you apply for a long\u2011term study D visa with a letter of acceptance from a recognised institution, proof of tuition payment (often full or at least \u20ac6,000), English\u2011language test scores, medical insurance, and explanations of study and career plans. From mid\u20112025, financial requirements increased: students generally must now show at least about \u20ac12,000 in liquid, traceable funds for living costs, up from \u20ac10,000 under previous rules. Indian and other non\u2011EU students on a valid student permission can usually work part\u2011time during term and full\u2011time during scheduled breaks, and may access post\u2011study work routes (typically 1\u20132 years) before moving to an employment permit if eligible. Work and employment\u2011related policies Non\u2011EU nationals usually need an employment permit (e.g., Critical Skills or General Employment Permit) plus a corresponding D visa before travelling to take up work. Policy updates up to 2025 have expanded the list of eligible occupations (e.g., some social care and technical trades) and reduced the minimum period before changing employers from 12 to 9 months for first\u2011time permit holders. Spouses and partners of certain permit holders now have broader rights to work without their own employment permit, although some dependants must wait 12 months before relocating and others receive non\u2011work Stamp 3 permission. Visit, processing times, and documentation Tourist/visitor C visas typically require a completed online application, passport valid at least 6 months beyond intended stay, photos, fee payment, proof of funds, accommodation, travel plans, and letters explaining purpose and intention to return. Typical processing times for C tourist visas are in the range of about 15\u201325 working days, but can be longer if extra checks are needed or during busy seasons. Official ISD tables regularly publish which application dates are currently being processed for different visa types (tourism, study, employment, etc.), useful for planning. Immigration permission stamps and residence After entry, your passport is stamped with an immigration permission type (Stamp 1 for most workers, Stamp 2 for full\u2011time students, Stamp 3 for non\u2011working dependants, Stamp 4 for certain long\u2011term residents and family members, etc.). These stamps, plus the Irish Residence Permit card, govern what you can legally do in Ireland: work, study, start a business, or simply reside without work rights. Extensions or changes of status usually require applying to ISD with updated documents before your current permission expires."
